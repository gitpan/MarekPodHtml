Marek::Pod::HTML
----------------

This is an evaluation distribution of a new POD to HTML converter.
It is portable and based on many other Perl modules so that it benefits
from their development, too.

!! As soon as the gurus approve that this is the way to go, the Marek::
!! namespace will be dropped.

CONTENTS

This package contains

Marek::Pod::HTML - the workhorse module
mpod2html - a script that makes use of the above

AUTHORS

Marek Rouchal, reusing (huge) parts of almost all POD to HTML converters
out there on CPAN, notably

Tom Christiansen's original pod2html
Nick Ing-Simmons' PodToHtml (main source of inspiration for this design)

Thanks for comments and contributions to

Brad Appleton
Wolfgang Laun
Norbert Gruener
Harald Joerg
